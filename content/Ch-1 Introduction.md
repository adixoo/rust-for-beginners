# Rust Introduction

Rust is a new, powerful programming language created by Mozilla. It's designed to make programs fast, reliable, and safe. Unlike older languages like C and C++, Rust helps you avoid common programming mistakes that can cause crashes or security problems. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of Rust, so you can start building your own amazing projects!

## Features of Rust

- **Performance**: Rust is designed for performance. Its execution speed is comparable to languages like C and C++
- **Memory Safety**: Rust is a smart language that keeps your programs safe! It prevents common mistakes like accidentally using memory that's already been freed or trying to use something that doesn't exist. Unlike other languages, Rust doesn't rely on a garbage collector to clean up memory. Instead, it uses a special system called ownership to keep track of memory and make sure it's used correctly. This makes your programs faster and more reliable.
